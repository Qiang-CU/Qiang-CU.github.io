# About

I am a Ph.D. candidate in computational and applied mathematics at the [Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES)](https://www.ices.utexas.edu/) in the The University of Texas at Austin, where I am supervised by [Professor Leszek Demkowicz](http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~leszek/). I plan to graduate in May of 2018 and am looking for postdoctoral opportunities at the moment. <br>

I was a [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics fellow](http://www.whoi.edu/gfd/) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in 2017.
Previously, I obtained a M.Sc. in computational methods in aeronautical enginnering from Imperial College London, and bachelor's degrees in both mathematics and mechanical engineering from the Universidad de los Andes (Colombia).

My research lies in the interdisciplinary intersection of mathematics, physics, engineering and computer science.
More specifically, I do research in computational mathematics that involves numerical analysis and nonlinear dynamics.
Within numerical analysis, I am interested in finite element methods and applied functional analysis.
In the last few years, I have helped develop some of the latest advances in discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methods, which are very effective at solving partial differential equations (PDEs), and have many physical applications.
Within nonlinear dynamics, I like to study hydrodynamic stability of classical flows, like plane Couette flow.
Here, we pose (fluid) dynamical systems in the form of a semidefinite program (SDP) with sum-of-squares (SoS) constraints, and then use a computer to derive some important stability properties of the dynamical system.
