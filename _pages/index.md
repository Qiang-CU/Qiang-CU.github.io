# About

I just completed my Ph.D. in computational and applied mathematics at the [Institute for
Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES)](https://www.ices.utexas.edu/) in the The University
of Texas at Austin, where I am supervised by [William H. Press](http://www.numerical.recipes/whp) and [Ilya J.
Finkelstein](http://www.finkelsteinlab.org). I am looking for postdoctoral opportunities in computational
molecular biology at the moment. 

I was awarded the Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Fellowship for my studies at
ICES, where I obtained my Masters and Ph.D. degrees. I previously earned a B.S. in Mathematics, a
B.S.E in Mechanical Engineering, and a B.A. in Humanities at Walla Walla University in Walla Walla,
Washington.

My research is centered around developing high-throughput methods and results in molecular and
integrative biology.  The gold rush in molecular and integrative biology for exponentially improved
insights and methods is in full swing, and I love being a part of it.  My specialty is using
computational and mathematical techniques to extract insight from large data sets and design better
experiments, and I have also done a small amount of bench work. My current research is in
developing novel techniques for characterizing the CRISPR family of proteins, with the long-term
goal of helping to make gene-editing techniques safe for clinical use. Along the way I also derived
and designed state of the art indel-correcting DNA barcodes and performed one of the largest-scale
phylogenetic and positive selection analyses of bats. For these projects I have used various
mathematical and computational methods, including mathematical model development, Fourier methods,
non-linear optimization, finite field linear algebra, machine learning, visualization, phylogenetic
analysis, positive selection analysis, and algorithmic development in high-dimensional spaces.

When I'm not doing research, my favorite thing in the world is to go see the world. I love
travelling, learning languages, and meeting people. Closer to home, nothing beats weekend BBQ's
with friends in the back yard.  I also love listening to podcasts and audiobooks while going for
walks. Shout out to 99 Percent Invisible, More Perfect by RadioLab, and the Harry Potter books as
read by Stephen Fry.
