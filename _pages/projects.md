### Oil and gas industry chain optimization

To optimize the production plan of oil and gas industry chain, we model it as a nonlinear mixed integer problem, which is a variant of standard pooling problem. We develop a multi-processing Branch and Cut algorithm to solve it . The solving time of each model is cut at least in half.

### Online matching and resource allocation in E-commerce platform 

To avoid Matthew Effect, we model it as a guaranteed delivery problem. With the help of problem structure, we apply online primal-dual algorithm to distribute resource (chance of impression).

We also found a novel periodic reduction of specificity
every 3 + 6*n* bases in the target sequence.  We were then able to use our method to look at the
binding specificity for a CRISPR protein across an entire human exome for the first time.  This
technique can be used in a clinical setting to verify *in vitro* the safety of a proposed
gene-therapy treatment on a per-patient basis. 


## State of the Art Barcoding: FREE Barcodes

DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences used to label individual biomolecules in pooled populations, are
ubiquitous throughout modern biology. This simple technology has enabled the development of
exciting new assaysly concatenated. This allows for combinatorially large
barcode libraries and/or arbitrarily low error rates with different strategies. I demonstrated
these possibilities with an example library with &gt;10<sup>15</sup> barcodes and an example
library with error rates of &lt;10<sup>-19</sup>.

The order Chiroptera, the order of bats, is one of the most interesting and diverse orders of
mammals. Not only are they interesting due 
in the bat NPC1 protein which acts as a barrier to cell entry and infection from the Ebola virus. -->
