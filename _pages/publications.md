Most of my publications should be indexed in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NjVNiJ8AAAAJ&hl=en), and I will try to keep the most recent version of my publications here as well.

<!-- This paper studies the performative prediction problem which optimizes a stochastic loss function with data distribution that depends on the decision variable. We consider a forgotful settings of performative prediction problem, where the update dynamics is controlled by a Markov chain. Besides, we show that the expected squared distance to the fixed point solution decreases as $O(1/k)$, where $k$ is the iteration number.  -->
