I am a mathematical scientist and computational mechanician, and my research lies in the interdisciplinary intersection of mathematics, physics, engineering and computer science.
Currently I have two main lines of research:
- Numerical analysis, and more specifically, finite element analysis, where numerical methods are developed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) using a computer.
- Applied nonlinear dynamics, particularly hydrodynamic stability of incompressible fluid systems, where important properties are studied with the aid of a computer via semidefinite programs (SDPs) with sum-of-square (SoS) constraints.
